# Custom_ORM

### About

This App allows the user to view all of the 'burgers' available, choose to eat or un-eat any burger, and add a new burger to the list of burgers.

This app was built to test skills in following MVC design patterns and using templating engines to render html content. The application uses Node and MySQL to query and route data, and Handlebars to generate HTML. All data is stored in a MySQL database.

### Walkthrough

When the application loads, the user will see two lists of burgers: those that have been eaten, and those that are waiting to be eaten. By clicking the button next to each burger name, the user can move burgers from one list to the other, and vice versa.

The user can add a burger to either list (which also adds the burger to the MySQL database) by filling out the form at the bottom of the application.
